# Simple REST API with CRUD Operations

This project demonstrates the development of a simple REST API capable of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a "person" name. The API interfaces with a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **Read:** Fetch details of a person by ID or retrieve all persons.
- **Update:** Modify details of an existing person by ID.
- **Delete:** Remove a person by ID.
